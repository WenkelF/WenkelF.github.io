My name is Frederik. I am originally from Munich, Germany and work in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I believe AI can greatly help us solve tasks that are traditionally challenging for us humans.

Currently, I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Mathematics at University of Montreal and Mila - Quebec AI institute under the supervision of Prof. Guy Wolf.

My research interests are at the intersection of Geometric Deep Learning and Graph Signal Processing, where I work on applications in Social Networks, Finance and Biochemistry.
