**My name is Frederik.** I am originally from Munich, Germany and work in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I believe AI can greatly help us solve tasks that are traditionally challenging for us humans.

Currently, I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Mathematics at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) and [Mila - Quebec AI institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Guy Wolf](http://guywolf.org/).

My research interests are at the intersection of **Geometric Deep Learning** and **Graph Signal Processing**, where I work on applications in Social Networks, Finance and Biochemistry.
